<h2>👋 About Me</h2>

<p>
  I'm currently enrolled in the <strong>ALX [Software Engineering ]</strong> and on a mission to transform my GitHub profile into a powerful reflection of my journey, passion, and purpose in tech.
</p>

<p>
  I chose to dive into <strong>Front-End Developer</strong> because I’m deeply inspired by the intersection of <strong>nature</strong>, <strong>travel</strong>, <strong>sports</strong>, <strong>education</strong>, <strong>technology</strong>, <strong>automobiles</strong>, and <strong>fine craftsmanship like watches</strong>. These elements shape the way I think, create, and solve problems.
</p>

<h2>🎯 My Vision</h2>

<p>
  <strong>My goal:</strong> To help build a more inclusive and connected world — a world for everyone, everywhere.
</p>

<p>
  This is why I'm particularly interested in working on projects that contribute to <strong>open education platforms</strong> like <em>Udemy</em> or <em>ALX Africa</em>, and innovative <strong>advertising solutions</strong> for global brands.
</p>
